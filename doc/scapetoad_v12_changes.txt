ScapeToad 1.2 - What's new
--------------------------


1. The cartogram computation has been optimized for speed and for memory usage.

2. The diffusion algorithm uses now a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration method for solving the diffusion equation.

3. The Fourier transform is now parallelized and is therefore able to use more than one processor on your system.

4. The cartogram and diffusion grids are now of the same size, which speeds up the computation, diminishes the memory usage, and is less confusing for the user.

5. A problem with memory management causing eventually ScapeToad to hang has been solved.
